Before installation
-------------------

We strongly recommend making a complete backup of the shop's files and database before
any module installation or update.

Also, the installation and module functionality should be completely verified on a testing or
staging system before moving it into a production system.

Installing the module
---------------------

The module needs to be installed with Composer. Other installation procedures are not
officially supported.

The module does not make any changes to the database.

No new attributes are added to Magento®.

.. admonition:: Composer usage

    Basic questions about setting up and using Composer in Magento® are not covered by our
    technical support. Please refer to these official documentations:

    * https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md
    * https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.1/comp-mgr/install-extensions.html

Installing from package using Composer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow these steps:

* Copy the TGZ or ZIP package into a folder that is accessible by Composer.
  **Do not unzip the package!**
* On the command line, navigate into the root folder of your Magento® installation.
* Execute the following commands:

::

    composer config repositories.dhlexpress artifact /path/to/folder/with/package/
    composer require dhl/module-rates-express
    composer update

**Note:** The path to the package in the above example is absolute, i.e. starting at
the server (Linux) root. The path must point to the folder, **not** to the package itself.
Omit the filename!

* Check if any errors occurred at this point, and resolve them. See the Composer documentation:
  https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md
* Then execute the following commands:

::

    php bin/magento module:enable Dhl_ExpressRates --clear-static-content
    php bin/magento setup:upgrade
    php bin/magento cache:flush
    php bin/magento setup:di:compile
    php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy en_US en_GB fr_FR de_DE it_IT es_ES

**Note**: After the command "setup:static-content:deploy", put the list of your shop's locales.
The above is just an example (but it should cover most scenarios).

* Check if any errors occured.
* Then proceed with the `Configuration`_.
